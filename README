How to open in IntelliJ (hopefully):

-Import from VCS
-Hope to god it also took the settings as I've shared those through VCS
-If not, go to Application Settings, make a new template as Application:
    Main Class: jss.Main
    Class Path: JSS
    JRE: 1.8 SDK

Project Structure (ctrl+alt+shift+s):
    Project SDK: Java 1.8 (Java version 1.8.0_221)
    Language Level: 8

Settings (ctrl+alt+s):
    Compiler -> Java Compiler
    Compiler: Javac
    Module: JSS
    Bytecode: 8

That should hopefully be it.


How to open in Eclipse (hopefully):

-Download as zip
-Extract to a folder of your choice (I'd recommend it being named JSS)
-Import the project in Eclipse (eclipse import files are included in the project)
-Convert it to a Maven Project
-Change the Compliance level to be at least 1.7
